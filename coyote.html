<b><p>The ford crate engines website has three coyote 302 engines that it sell's, and although they
  the block and a lot of the parts are the same, the engines mostly have different purposes.

</p></b>

</div></center>

<div class="divvy4">
  <p>The block number <a class="dirt" href="https://performanceparts.ford.com/part/M-6007-A50NAA">M-6007-A50NAA</a> is the first 302 in the selection. This is the top of the line 302. Nicknamed the alluminator for its alluminum block, it makes an
  advertised 435+ horsepower, and 400+IB-ft of torque. It includes improved internals, a nominal 11.0:1 compression, and improved connecting rods and forged pistons coated
with a low friction coating. This all sounds good and amazing, a 435 horsepower N/A engine ready for some bolt on mods, but there are a few drawback, firstly, the price.
It has a price tag of 10,995.00, and if that wasn't enought, you can run no less than 91 octane, because of the 11.0:1 compression, and on top of that, since this no ordinairy coyote,
normal 302 parts won't necessairily just bolt on, so more expensive parts equals more money out of your pocket. </p>
</div>

<div class="divvy4">
<p>The block number <a class="dirt" href="https://performanceparts.ford.com/part/M-6007-A50SCA">M-6007-A50SCA</a> is the second 302 in the selection. Specifically designed for forced induction, it has a lower compression than the previous engine, only 9.5:1
  and hardened forged pistons and connecting rods. speacilized forged crank, and ford performance spark plugs for forced induction. also the heads include BOSS 302 valve springs. But the downsides are somewhat substantial if you want to bring the
  engine to its full potential. The actual engine costs again, 10,995.00, which is a lot, considering you then should get a supercharger, which they hover around 6,000. Then you need, again, 91 octane, and then to actual engine, and then to tune it. In the
  end it comes to about a 20,000 dollar bill if you don't already have the parts.
</p>

</div>
<div class="divvy4">
<p>The block number <a class="dirt" href="https://performanceparts.ford.com/part/M-6007-M50A">M-6007-M50A</a>is the standard 302 from the mustang, with 445 horsepower and 400ft.-IB of torque. It includes forged connecting rods, but not pistons. This is because it is the standard
  coyote, although it still holds the 11.0:1 compression. Although it does not have all the fancy parts that the others have, it is still a fine engine. The only thing about it is that you can't beat on it as if it were the harder built one, but it is fine for dropping in a foxbody
  and cruising, burnouts, and maybe even challenging a WS6 to a drag. With a price tag of 7,975.00, it is around the same price as the comparable 6.2L Chevrolet LS3, with more power out of the crate. But again you need to run 91.

</p>

<div class="divvy4">
<p>Our final coyote is the <a class="dirt" href="https://performanceparts.ford.com/part/M-6007-M50SA">M-6007-M50SA</a>is an engine leaning more toward racing, more specifically it's a sealed engine use for NMRA-Coyote sanctioned racing.it make 435HP at 6500 rpm and 400 feet pounds of
  torque at 4250 with 91. The engine also features a reinforced block that does not comprimise the weight. With 11.0:1 compression, it is fairly similair to the other engines in the 302 class.
