<b><p>The ford crate website has 6 different pushrod 302 engines to choose from.

  <p>The block number <a class="dirt" href="https://performanceparts.ford.com/part/M-6007-Z2427FFT">M-6007-Z2427FFT</a> is the first 351 block on the list. Based of the BOSS 351 from the 1971 production year,
    the block is similair to the BOSS 302 mentioned before. This new engine has the new performance z2 heads made by ford, also featured on the 302 block on their website. This engine has been bored and stroked
    to 427 cubic inches, giving it the ability to have a bae horsepower rating of 535 at 5600rpm, and 545 ft ib at 4500rpm. With a compression of 10.5:1, this is very good for an engine based on an ancient
    architecture. With forged pistons, crank and connecting rods, this is a tough engine. There are some drawbacks, the price is 11,500.00, this is tough when you could get the 302 for almost 2000 less and gain
    a higher red line, while only loosing a few horsepower and torque while having a smaller design.

  <p>The block number <a class="dirt" href="https://performanceparts.ford.com/part/M-6007-Z460FFT">M-6007-Z460FFT</a>is the second 351 on the list. It is the biggest available block from the ford crate engines,
    with 460 cubic inches of displacement or 7.5L. All of this out of a small windsor base. This is the second most powerfull engine available from the website with 575, 5 behind the voodoo. This engine features
    all that power at 5500RPM and 575 ft ib of torque at 4700RPM. With very strong internals, most of which are forged, this is a good engine to swap in to a hot rod, or maybe an old foxbody, but with a price tag
    of a suprising 11000, it is more affordable than the 427, and is a fairly good alternative to a voodoo, if you want a cheaper 575+ HP alternative, or don't have much engine space, or maybe you want an older setup,
    either way a good thing to consider. This also come is rear sump flavor <a class="dirt" href="https://performanceparts.ford.com/part/M-6007-Z2427FRT">M-6007-Z2427FRT</a>.
