<b><p>The ford crate website has 6 different pushrod 302 engines to choose from.

  <p>The block number <a class="dirt" href="https://performanceparts.ford.com/part/M-6007-Z2363FT">M-6007-Z2363FT</a> is the first 302 in the selection. In 1969 to 1970, ford decided to spruce up its existing 302 for the new Mustang BOSS, giving it many improvements such as cleveland heads,
4 bolt main and block reinforcing. Later, in the 21 century, ford decided to do a limited run of newer 302 engines with all new internals, but this was still 302 cubic inches of displacement. So later, they decided to make a much bigger engine on a modified version of this block, bringing it up
to 363 cubic inches, or 5.9L. With much more displacement to work with, the Ford team was able to bring up the base horsepower to 507 at 6500 RPM, 450 ft ib at 5100. With a 10.2:1 compression, forged crank, forged pistons and forged connecting rods, this engine is less displacement then a ls3, but is already
looking better in the specs. This engine is perfect for a foxbody, or maybe a fairlaine or hot rod, but this engine does not come without some issues. the parts may be much more expensive then a standard windsor or ls3, and the engine itself has a price tag of 10,650.00, so its more expensive than a ls3, and you
can get the base coyote for that much. one good thing though is that you can get the same engine with rear sump pan for the same price, it is just with the part number <a class="dirt"  href="https://performanceparts.ford.com/part/M-6007-Z2363RT">M-6007-Z2363RT</a>
