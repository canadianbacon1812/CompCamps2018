<b><p>The ford crate engines website has one 5.2L (317) voodoo crate engine, similair to the shelby gt350, but put on steroids.

<div class="divvy4">
  <p>The 5.2 voodoo, block number <a class="dirt" href="https://performanceparts.ford.com/part/M-6007-A52XS">M-6007-A52XS</a> is a new engine based off the 5.2 in the new shelby GT 350 mustang.
   The engine in this car was one of the best engines ever made by Ford, and so they decided to put it on steroids. With a 12.0:1 compression, 580 horsepower, 445ft ib of torque,
 it is the most powerfull modualr crate engine made from ford. This engine utilises a speacial cross plane crank, similair to the technology used by ferrari on some of its engines, also the engine can handle a red-line of 8,250 RPM!
 It utilises the block from the 5.0 Coyote, bored and stroked to 5.2L, forged Crank, forged pistons, a Cobra Jet tuned intake with dual 65mm throttle bodies, and some unique camshafts make this voodoo
one of the best Ford engines ever made. But all this comes at a price, a quite large price tag of 19,995.00 dollars, on top of that, with a 12:1 compression, it requires quit a high octane
fuel, it is not the most fuel efficient engine, and on top of that, this engine will not fit the standard 2015-2017 mustang engine bay, because of the enlarged intake, so it requres ajusting or replacement of the stock hood. </p>
