<b><p>The ford crate engines website has three coyote 302 engines that it sell's, and although they
  the block and a lot of the parts are the same, the engines mostly have different purposes.

</p></b>

</div></center>

<div class="divvy4">
  <p>The block number <a class="dirt" href="https://performanceparts.ford.com/part/M-6007-A50NAA">M-6007-A50NAA</a> is the first 302 in the selection. This is the top of the line 302. Nicknamed the alluminator for its alluminum block, it makes an
  advertised 435+ horsepower, and 400+IB-ft of torque. It includes improved internals, a nominal 11.0:1 compression, and improved connecting rods and forged pistons coated
with a low friction coating. This all sounds good and amazing, a 435 horsepower N/A engine ready for some bolt on mods, but there are a few drawback, firstly, the price.
It has a price tag of 10,995.00, and if that wasn't enought, you can run no less than 91 octane, because of the 11.0:1 compression, and on top of that, since this no ordinairy coyote,
normal 302 parts won't necessairily just bolt on, so more expensive parts equals more money out of your pocket. </p>
